# pyscript
make_presentation.py
requirements:
Latex distribution (I use texlive)
pdflatex foro compilation and beamer package. for slides
python > 2.6.6 

Use:
./make_presentation.py pic_folder  outfile.tex
this will produce a  folder named outfileout.
In this foder you will find a file named outfile.tex with the latex code of the 
presentation and a file called outfile.pdf with the presentation.
Each picture will be in a separate slide. This script is used as starting point.
